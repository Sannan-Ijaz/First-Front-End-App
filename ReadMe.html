<h1>Tic Tac Toe: Beach Version</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>"Tic Tac Toe: Beach version" is an endless 'Zen' 3x3 tic-tac-toe game. Inspired by me playing Alto's Adventure which is an endless snowboarding running game with beautiful graphics and soothing background music which helps the player to relax and play for countless hours.Similar to that, "Tic Tac Toe: Beach Version" provides a soothing backdrop and audio to let you enjoy play tic tac toe endlessly.</p>
<h2>Development</h2>
<p><h3>Technologies Used:</h3></p>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<h3>Process</h3>
<p>JavaScript: To make the game, I started with developing the pseudocode for thhe functionality. Strting out, I designed the 3 by 3 grid through html and CSS. For Java Script Code, I wanted to keep the code as concise as I could. Identifying and manipulating DOM APIs allowed me to map the grid with numbers, which could be used to decide win and draw conditions.</p>
<p>Win and Draw Conditions: For each cell clicked, cell registered a move and a class was added to that cell. Each time a cell was clicked, a function was run to check if either the win or the draw conditions have been met. </p>
<p>HTML: Three different pages were made for the user to interact with the game, a start screen, an option screen, and the actual game screen. The design was kept in mind to look simple but engaging.</p>
<p>CSS: With CSS, The buttons were styled with the beach theme. Two backdrops, a day and a night, while the game is running in the front, served as a perfect complement. Finally, a soundtrack was added with waves crashing so you can lay on your couch and play with your friend or enjoy solo (Much better choice!!)</p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>As with all the coding projects, or atleast I believe that, most of my time was spent implementing my ideas into the game. I will say that this game is not perfect and there is so much that can be improved.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, my main focus was to keep the JavaScript code concise. One of the targets I had was to design a function which could automatically check if the win or lose conditions are met. For that, I tried to compare arrays, but went to a dead-end when I realised that I will have to add a lot more possibilities for each player's turn. Ultimately, I manipulated DOM elements to check the conditions in each cell and got the result.</p>
<p>Another challenge was putting a picture instead of color change in each cell. This feature has not been added, but will be in the future.</p>
<h3>Lessons</h3>
<p>Planning and Organisation are perhaps the most important parts of the project which I aim to improve on in the next projects. At the end, I feel that HTML,CSS, and JavaScript can be improved a lot for this project, and would have been if proper planning and time allocations would have been done.</p>
